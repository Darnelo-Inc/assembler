# assembler

The result of my learning Assembly language. 
The entire synopsis is placed in a file [INFO.md](https://github.com/Darnelo-Inc/assembler/blob/main/INFO.md) . It contains everything you need to write programs in Assembly language. During the review of the synopsis, see the corresponding program topics in the folders. 

All programs contain a brief explanation of the actions performed in the line. The 'hello' programs describe all the actions, in the following some points are omitted to reduce the volume (code SEGMENT lines etc.). 

The programs are written using ms-dos in 16-bit mode. The installation tutorial is in the video specified in the INFO file in the Assembler part.
